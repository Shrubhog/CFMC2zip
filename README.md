# CFMC2zip
A tool to bulk download Minecraft mods on [Minecraft Curseforge](minecraft.curseforge.com). I've come across situations where I want to download many mods but cannot concentrate them in a spot.
## What this aims to be
* An easy way to add mods to a list and download them
* A packager for mods
* Web based, but a CLI might be developed later
* (possible) A compatibility checker. (will check for known incompatibilities)
## What it is not and WILL NOT be
* A tool that automatically grants you permission to use the said mods in a modpack without asking their creator
* A mod loader
* Your magical cure all that handles bugs with all mods. If your mods are incompatible with each other, CFMC2zip cannot solve it. (although it might tell you if they are incompatible)
